# TIDBIT

A calories counting application

## Introduction

In the 21st century, the availability of food options has significantly increased, making it challenging for
individuals to monitor their food intake effectively. This trend has led to a growing number of people who
are seeking to become more mindful of what they eat to maintain their health and well-being. Despite their
best efforts, many of these health-conscious individuals struggle to maintain their new habits due to the
arduous nature of their methods.

That's why, our team 'Tidbit' is offering an easy-to-use calorie-tracking mobile application. Now, users can
capture their food pick and get notified about the nutritional data instantly.

## Usability Problem

One challenge that health-conscious individuals often encounter is the difficulty of accurately assessing
the nutritional value of foods they consume. Diet-conscious individuals may struggle to estimate the
ingredients that make up certain foods, as well as to predict the overall calorie count. This can lead to a
lack of confidence in the accuracy of their dietary tracking and may hinder their progress toward their
health goals.

In modern times, individuals lead busy, structured lives, leaving them with little time to spare. As such,
many opt to use mobile applications to help them stay mindful of their nutritional intake. However, even
with the assistance of these apps, the daily task of inputting nutritional information requires a significant
amount of effort and time from the individual.

Diet-conscious individuals may struggle to estimate the ingredients that make up certain foods
and predict the overall calorie count.
